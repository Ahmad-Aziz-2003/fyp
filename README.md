Dast-e-Khair is a donation platform aimed at connecting donors with NGOs working in various sectors such as education, healthcare, and disaster relief. Most small or lesser-known NGOs often lack visibility and technical infrastructure, which makes it hard for them to raise donations or get volunteers. This project provides a centralized platform where donors, NGOs, and administrators can interact seamlessly.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In Pakistan, many NGOs—especially the smaller or less popular ones—struggle to gain visibility and donor trust due to lack of proper digital platforms. Donors often prefer donating to already established organizations. Our project, *Dast-e-Khair*, addresses this gap by creating a reliable platform that empowers all NGOs equally and provides donors with transparency and ease of access. It also includes emergency volunteer features, project tracking, and donation management.
